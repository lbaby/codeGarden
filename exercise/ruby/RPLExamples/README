This directory contains example code from the book _The Ruby Programming
Language_, by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto and published by
O'Reilly Media. (ISBN 978-0-596-51617-8).

The files with ".rb" extensions are numbered examples from the book.
Example 1-1, for example is in the file 1-1.rb.  That first example is a
complete working Ruby program for solving Sudoku puzzles. Most of the
other numbered examples, however, consist of class and method
definitions and cannot be run as standalone programs.

Most of the code in the book takes the form of unnumbered examples. The
files with ".txt" extensions consist of code extracted from each of the
chapters of the book.  For example, the file Chapter1Listings.txt
contains all of the code from Chapter 1, including example 1-1. If,
while reading Chapter 1, you find some code that you'd like to try out,
you can cut-and-paste it from this file.

This code, like the book it is taken from, is copyright (c) 2008 by
David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto, but you can use it under the
terms described in the book's preface:
